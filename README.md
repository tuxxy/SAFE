# SAFE (Safe Access File Exchange)

Mainly a work in progress and mostly conceptual and should not be used in production until further notice.

The objective is to make a tool that is similar to how the US Army's AMRDEC (Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center) Safe Access File Exchange tool works.

You can see how this tool works via the Department of Defense's site, however, you will not be able to use it unless you have the DoD certificates and have the proper credentials. 
When you access the site, you will get a certificate error. This is because you do not have the DoD certs. There is nothing wrong with your browser or their server.
